# SpotifyAuthentication

This app will help to get the Authentication in Spotify account using token from your account!
 * Set up an Android Studio project for your app,
 * Authenticate a user,
 * Play an audio stream from Spotify. (Premium accounts only)
 
 The app we will create is very simple. It has just a single Activity, Adapter, HelperClass etc. created by Android Studio. 
 When the app starts it authenticates the user, gets the userâ€™s authorization to stream a track, 
 and starts playing that track. The complexities of Android app development are beyond the scope of 
 this tutorial; our aim is simply to help you set up your environment and project correctly and to make 
 sure you can connect to the Spotify service.
